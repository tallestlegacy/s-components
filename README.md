# S_Components

These are reusable components [made with svelte](https://svelte.dev), customising a lot of [Shadcn-Svelte](https://shadcn-svelte.com) components and adding some custom components I find myself needing.

This library is meant for the Sytron project, you're welcome to use them anyway.
